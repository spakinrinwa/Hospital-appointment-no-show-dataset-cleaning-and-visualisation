# Hospital-appointment-no-show-dataset-cleaning-and-visualization

Background to the study: In this work, I am analysing a dataset that holds information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil with a focus on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

This report is based on the following questions:

Are people with scholarship more likely to show up?
Do people show up more to hospitals in a particular neighbourhood?
Are people in these categories more likely or unlikely to show up for hospital appointments: Hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handicap?
Do people who fall in more than one disease category show up more for their hospital appointments?
Do people show up more when they've received sms about their appointments?
What day of the week has the highest number of no-shows?
What gender is most likely to not show up for the appointment?
What age bin is most likely to not show up for their hospital appointments?
